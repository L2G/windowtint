## FAQ

### Why not just tell everyone to use ANSICON and be done with it?

Because not everyone can use ANSICON.  ANSICON is a system-level driver that has to
be installed by hand alongside other Windows drivers.  Some environments (schools,
laboratories, etc.) have stringent usage policies that forbid users tampering with
operating system files.
